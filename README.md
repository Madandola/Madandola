# Hi there 👋, I'm Michael Erunkulu

Welcome to my GitHub! 

I'm a passionate, motivated and detail-oriented professional transitioning into data analytics after a successful career as a customer service assistant and security in the transportation industry. I recently completed the **Just IT Skills Bootcamp in Data Technician**, where I built real-world projects in Excel, Power BI, SQL, Python, Data cleaning and Visualisation focused on transforming raw data into actionable insights. I'm a confident communicator who has demonstrated reliability and analytical thinking in previous posts. Able to use real-time information to effectively problem solve and passionate about using data to identify trends when influencing decision making and improving business performance.

I’m passionate about turning complex datasets into clear, meaningful stories that help drive better decisions.
